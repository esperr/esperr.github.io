Hi! I'm Ed Sperr. I'm the Clinical Information Librarian at the [AU/UGA Medical Partnership](http://medicalpartnership.usg.edu/). There I work with residents on developing the skills needed to find and evaluate the information necessary for clinical decision-making.  

I am interested in finding new ways to visualize and interact with bibliographic data.

Feel free to look at my [CV](/assets/sperr_CV.pdf).
