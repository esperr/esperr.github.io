Hi! I'm Ed Sperr. I'm the Systems and Discovery Librarian at the [University of Georgia Libraries](https://www.libs.uga.edu/). There I help keep the figurative lights on as we work towards our big migration to the [FOLIO library system](https://folio.org/).

My primary research interest is in finding new ways to visualize and interact with bibliographic data.

Feel free to look at my [CV](/assets/sperr_CV.pdf).
