Hi! I'm Ed Sperr. I'm the Clinical Information Librarian at the [AU/UGA Medical Partnership](http://medicalpartnership.usg.edu/), where I work with residents on  developing the skills needed to find and evaluate the information necessary for clinical decision-making.  

I am interested in finding new ways to visualize and interact with bibliographic data.
