I've done some Fall Fixin' on [News in Proportion](http://esperr.github.io/newsinproportion/) to reflect recent changes to the [Chronicling America API](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/) and make the app layout more well-behaved.

* Added Alaska, Wisconsin and Delaware to list of states mapped
* Expanded date range to 1786(!) -- 1943
* Shoehorned existing layout into Bootstrap (there may be room for more tweaking here...)
