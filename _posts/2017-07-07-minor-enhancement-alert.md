This is a quick announcement that I have added a new feature to [PubVenn](https://pubvenn.appspot.com/). You can now share a favorite search via URL (just as you can with [PubMed by Year](https://esperr.github.io/pubmed-by-year/)).

Searches can range from the simple (<a href="https://pubvenn.appspot.com/?beer%20AND%20wine">Beer AND Wine</a>) to the complex <a href="https://pubvenn.appspot.com/?(%22education%2C%20medical%22%5BMeSH%20Major%20Topic%5D%20OR%20%22medicine%2Feducation%22%5BMeSH%20Major%20Topic%5D)%20AND%20(%22communication%22%5BMeSH%20Major%20Topic%5D%20OR%20%22communication%20skills%22%5Ball%20fields%5D)">("education, medical"[MeSH Major Topic] OR "medicine/education"[MeSH Major Topic]) AND ("communication"[MeSH Major Topic] OR "communication skills"[all fields])</a>.

As always, please enjoy and let me know if you have any comments or suggestions for further improvements...
