I am pleased to announce that [Members by Interest](https://esperr.github.io/members-by-interest/) took “Honorable Mention” in the [Congressional Data Challenge](https://labs.loc.gov/experiments/congressionalchallenge/)! Many thanks to the judges and the folks at the Library of Congress. Many congratulations to the winners as well!

To celebrate the recognition, I’ve added the ability to link directly to an individual search. For example, to see a ranked list of House members for Bills and Resolutions for the policy area ‘Health’:
[http://esperr.github.io/members-by-interest/?congress=115&chamber=house&subjecttype=policy&subject=Health](http://esperr.github.io/members-by-interest/?congress=115&chamber=house&subjecttype=policy&subject=Health)

Or to see the particular interests of my own congressional delegation:

[https://esperr.github.io/members-by-interest/?congress=115&chamber=senate&subjecttype=policy&member=I000055](https://esperr.github.io/members-by-interest/?congress=115&chamber=senate&subjecttype=policy&member=I000055)

More enhancements coming soon...
