If you use [PubVenn](https://pubvenn.appspot.com/), you will note a small improvement in the way the printable output is handled. Now, if you click the "Printable version" link at the bottom of the diagram, you will see that the diagram that show up in the modal is now savable as a PNG file in all browsers. This seems more directly useful than a SVG file for most use cases.
