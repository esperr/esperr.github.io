A few weeks ago I was given the opportunity to present at the Spring 2019 meeting of the [Georgia Health Sciences Library Association](http://ghsla.org/) in lovely Madison, Georgia. It was a great chance to chat with my medical librarian colleagues, and I'm always eager to talk about [Search Workbench](https://searchworkbench.info/). If you wander over to the UGA IR, you'll find my slides for ["Beyond the List: Refining your PubMed searches with interactive visualizations"](http://hdl.handle.net/10724/38622).
