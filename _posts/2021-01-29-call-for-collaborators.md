title:  "Call for Collaborators: Testing Covid-19 Hedges"

There are a number of publicly available search strategies for finding Covid-19 related literature in PubMed, but there's not a lot of information about how well they work. Let's fix that by testing them!

In this project, we'll use some of the same concepts that I developed in an [ earlier project]({% post_url 2020-05-12-testing-pubmed-search-tester %}) to randomly generate a set of citations to appraise for fitness to purpose. Once we've collaboratively developed some validation sets of "good" items, we can use them to evaluate the different hedges we'll be testing.

I'm putting together a conference proposal right now, so let me know ASAP if you want to participate by emailing me at <a href="mailto:ed_sperr@hotmail.com">esperr@uga.edu</a>.
