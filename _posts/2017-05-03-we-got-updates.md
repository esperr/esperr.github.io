[PubVenn](https://pubvenn.appspot.com/) has been (finally) updated to the [newest verion](https://github.com/benfred/venn.js/tree/master) of Ben Frederickson's excellent venn.js.

Note to anyone using this version on a [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) site -- you'll run into a CSS class conflict for "label" elements in diagram(s). You can fool with less or namespaces or just include a local rule for "text.label"
