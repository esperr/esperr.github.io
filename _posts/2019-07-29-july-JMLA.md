Do use the [PubMed Clinical Queries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/clinical)? If so, you should be aware that the "Broad" scope may not be as broad as one would like. Instead, there are many occasions when items that appear in a "Narrow" scoped search just don't show up in their Broad counterpart. This is particularly true for Prognosis, where a searcher could easily miss one (presumably relevant) Prognosis/Narrow citation for every ten Prognosis/Broad citations retrieved.

Much more detail can be found in my new article, published in the most recent issue of JMLA:
