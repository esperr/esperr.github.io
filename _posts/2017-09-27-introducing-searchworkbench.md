Today marks the formal release of [Search Workbench](https://searchworkbench.info). A natural extension of the work in [Visualizing PubMed](https://esperr.github.io/visualizingpubmed/), Search Workbench allows you to examine, edit and visualize your PubMed searches from a single interface.

Each search you enter is displayed as both a Venn diagram of its constituent parts as well as a line graph showing how the proportions of your results change over time. More importantly, you can also directly *compare* completed searches to one another â€” facilitating the process of fine-tuning a search strategy.

Search Workbench allows for hand-editing the Automatic Term Mapping translation of a search and the application of one of several pre-defined hedges. It also supports the saving of individual search sessions and the sharing of those sessions as text files.

I hope this will be a useful tool for searchers -- please contact me at esperr@uga.edu with any critiques or enhancement requests.
