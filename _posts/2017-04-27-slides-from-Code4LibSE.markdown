I just put the slides from my presentation at [Code4LibSE 2017](https://wiki.code4lib.org/Southeast_2017) up on Athenaeum (the UGA IR): [http://hdl.handle.net/10724/36962](http://hdl.handle.net/10724/36962).

Of course, there were a *lot* of other cool presentations as well; you can see those linked to from [the conference schedule](https://wiki.code4lib.org/Southeast_2017_Schedule).
