This is just a quick note to say that I've taken a post as the Systems and Discovery Librarian at the [University of Georgia Libraries](https://www.libs.uga.edu/). There I'm going to help keep the figurative lights on as we work towards our big migration to the [FOLIO library system](https://folio.org/).

Thankfully, we'll have lots of help, as we're making this move in conjunction with all of our friends at [GALILEO Interconnected Libraries](https://gil.usg.edu/). 

Needless to say, there will be less [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) posting than before as I step aside from #MedLibs, but I will continue to work on the tools that I've developed as part of the [Visualizing PubMed Project](/visualizingpubmed/).
