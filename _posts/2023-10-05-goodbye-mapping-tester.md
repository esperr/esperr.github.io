As the NCBI has updated the [eutils](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/) API to point to the current version of PubMed, including the most recent version of [Automatic Term Mapping](https://hslguides.osu.edu/pubmed/automatic-term-mapping), there is no longer any access to 'old' PubMed.

Therefore, Mapping Tester is now defunct, though it's code is archived at: [https://github.com/esperr/mapping-tester](https://github.com/esperr/mapping-tester)
