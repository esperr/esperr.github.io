Just posted the recording of my lightning talk at the [2017 meeting of the Medical Library Association](http://www.mlanet.org/meeting) where I talked about [Visualizing PubMed](/visualizingpubmed). You get five minutes and three slides (though one *could* stretch that by using animations). Still can't believe how fast it went by...

If you want to hear somebody talking as fast as they reasonably can over a slide deck, feel free to [check it out](http://hdl.handle.net/10724/36987)!
