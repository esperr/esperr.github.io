Another talk I presented at the [2018 Meeting of the Medical Library Association](http://www.mlanet.org/meeting) was on something I discovered while testing the hedges feature in [Search Workbench](https://searchworkbench.info/). To wit, some searches using the "Narrow" version of a [Clinical Query](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/clinical) return results that are *not* seen when using the "Broad" version. This is particularly apparent when you examine the "Prognosis" queries:

This seems problematic if the idea behind the "Broad" version is to show as much relevant material as possible. I'm in the process of writing this up in more detail, but in the meantime, please take a look at my slide deck and supporting materials (archived on osf):
